#### Fixed

- v0.11.x updates increased library size to 17MB + when published to NPM. This has been raised in [#108](https://github.com/thegreenwebfoundation/co2.js/issues/108) and it was found data files were being included in the published package. (PR #117)

### [0.11.1] - 2022-10-07

#### Changed

- We have used generic filenames for data files, to avoid any confusion around the data being provided in this library. (PR #112)

### [0.11.0] - 2022-10-03

#### Added

- Introduced average and marginal carbon intensity data into the library. This comes from [Ember Climate](https://ember-climate.org/data/data-explorer/) (for average carbon intensity data), and [The Green Web Foundation](https://developers.thegreenwebfoundation.org/co2js/data) (marginal intensity data, originally sourced from the UNFCCC - the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change). For more, [see our release guide for v0.11](https://www.thegreenwebfoundation.org/news/release-guide-co2-js-v0-11/) about the differences between the kinds of data. See [#64](https://github.com/thegreenwebfoundation/co2.js/issues/64), and [#97](https://github.com/thegreenwebfoundation/co2.js/issues/97) for more.
- Added new paths to `import` and `require` the annual, country-level average and marginal carbon intensity data mentioned above like, as javascript objects, or as JSON. See [#104 for more](https://github.com/thegreenwebfoundation/co2.js/issues/104).
- Added links to CO2.js in forms already available on CDNs to avoid needing to npm install it to try it out. See [#105 for more](https://github.com/thegreenwebfoundation/co2.js/issues/105).
- Introduced scripts to automate the generation of grid intensity data based of Ember & UNFCCC source files.
- Introduced a `release:minor` command, to automate the publishing process, to complement `release:patch`.

#### Changed

- Changed the default model for transfer based CO2 calculations from the _1byte_ model to the _Sustainable Web Design_ model instead. See <https://developers.thegreenwebfoundation.org/co2js/models/> for guidance on the differences and how to migrate between them. See [#94 for more](https://github.com/thegreenwebfoundation/co2.js/issues/94).
- Updated our release commands to generate and format the carbon intensity data as part of the release process.

### [0.10.4] - 2022-08-12

#### Added

- Introduced a `release:patch` command, to automate the publishing process. This is designed to make sure we always publish the most recent compiled code, by adding a rebuild step that can be easy to forget.

### [0.10.3] - 2022-08-12

#### Added

- Introduced a new `perVisit()` function for the Sustainable Web Design model, which applies [caching and return visits assumptions](https://sustainablewebdesign.org/calculating-digital-emissions/).

### [0.10.2] - 2022-08-12

- Added the ability to set the model used by CO2.js to the Sustainable Web Design model, using a simple 'swd' string, instead of needing to pass in a class.

### [0.10.1] - 2022-08-01

This release used a version bump as previously we had released v0.10.0 under a pre-release tag.

### [0.10.0] - 2022-06-27

- Added ES import syntax as the main way for handling imports and exports of code within the module.
- Changed eslint settings to use later version of ecmascript (2020)
- Change the build tools to use esbulid with jest instead of babel
- Added more consistent use of the debug logging library in files using the updated import syntax
- Fixed the incorrect order of FIRST_TIME_VIEWING_PERCENTAGE and RETURNING_VISITOR_PERCENTAGE constants in the SWD model. This will result in **larger** values for calculations using the sustainable web design, and the default caching assumptions.

### [0.9.0] - 2022-03-28

#### Added

- Added newly implemented Sustainable Web Design model [thanks @dryden!]
- Added new readme page for using both emissions models
- Added new source of data to the Sustainable Web Design model from Ember Climate.

#### Changed

- Changed the CO2 class to accept either the One Byte model or the Sustainable Web Design model

#### Fixed

- Fixed various typos.

### [0.8.0] - 2021-11-28

####  Fixed

- Update further dependencies
- Fix embarassing order of magnitude typo in 1byte model (thanks @mstaschik!)

#### Added

- Read JSON blob also as gzipped #44 (thanks @soulgalore)

#### Changed

- The 1byte model will give different numbers now. It's mentioned in `#fixed` but it's worth repeating.

### [0.7.0] - 2021-11-28

#### Fixed

- Update tests to avoid network requests #50
- Update dependencies across the board

####  Changed

- Switch to github actions instead of travis for CI.

### [0.6.1] - 2020-03-15

#### Fixed

- Added the function to load JSON, on the tgwg.hosting object, for use in the sustaiable web sitespeed plugin.

### [0.6.0] - 2020-03-15

#### Added

- Added the hosting-JSON for running local checks against an array instead of SQLite.

#### Changed

- Swapped out checking against a sqlite database `hosting-json`in favour of simple array in,
- Updated conventions for style - using kebab-cases over CamelCase for naming files

#### Removed

- Extracted sqlite usage and dependencies into a separate module, `url2green`. This means you no longer need to compile SQLite on install.

### [0.5.0] - 2020-03-03

#### Changed

- Updated README
- Updated the emissions figured for green energy after further research on methodology with @@JamieBeevor
- Incorporated class based CO2 models from @soulgalore
- Credit contributors

### [0.4.7] - 2020-03-02

#### Added

- Added a changelog at last!

- Changelog inconsistency section in Bad Practices

### [0.4.4] - 2020-03-01

#### Added

Added the (currently unused) green byte model.

#### Changed

Update the 1byte model to use an average of devices, rather than just wifi

### [0.4.3] - 2020-03-01

#### Added

#### Changed

Split hosting API into two separate files (one for sqlite, and one relying on the greencheck API)
